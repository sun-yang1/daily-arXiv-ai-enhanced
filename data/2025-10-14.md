Motivation: The motivation is to address the risks of copyright infringement posed by unauthorized AI-based colorization of grayscale images, such as monochrome manga and films, for which no effective prevention method currently exists.

Method: The method involves embedding imperceptible perturbations into grayscale images using Perception-Aware Chroma-Restrictive Perturbation (PAChroma). It optimizes perturbations with a Laplacian filter for perceptual quality and applies diverse input transformations for transferability and robustness.

Result: Experiments on ImageNet and Danbooru datasets show that PAChroma effectively degrades colorization quality while maintaining visual appearance, meeting the criteria of effectiveness, imperceptibility, transferability, and robustness.

Conclusion: The paper introduces Uncolorable Examples and PAChroma as the first defensive paradigm to prevent unauthorized AI-based colorization, effectively degrading colorization quality while preserving visual appearance. This work pioneers copyright-aware defenses in generative media.

Abstract: AI-based colorization has shown remarkable capability in generating realistic
color images from grayscale inputs. However, it poses risks of copyright
infringement -- for example, the unauthorized colorization and resale of
monochrome manga and films. Despite these concerns, no effective method
currently exists to prevent such misuse. To address this, we introduce the
first defensive paradigm, Uncolorable Examples, which embed imperceptible
perturbations into grayscale images to invalidate unauthorized colorization. To
ensure real-world applicability, we establish four criteria: effectiveness,
imperceptibility, transferability, and robustness. Our method, Perception-Aware
Chroma-Restrictive Perturbation (PAChroma), generates Uncolorable Examples that
meet these four criteria by optimizing imperceptible perturbations with a
Laplacian filter to preserve perceptual quality, and applying diverse input
transformations during optimization to enhance transferability across models
and robustness against common post-processing (e.g., compression). Experiments
on ImageNet and Danbooru datasets demonstrate that PAChroma effectively
degrades colorization quality while maintaining the visual appearance. This
work marks the first step toward protecting visual content from illegitimate AI
colorization, paving the way for copyright-aware defenses in generative media.
