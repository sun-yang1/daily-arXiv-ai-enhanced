However, it poses risks of copyright\ninfringement -- for example, the unauthorized colorization and resale of\nmonochrome manga and films. Despite these concerns, no effective method\ncurrently exists to prevent such misuse. To address this, we introduce the\nfirst defensive paradigm, Uncolorable Examples, which embed imperceptible\nperturbations into grayscale images to invalidate unauthorized colorization. To\nensure real-world applicability, we establish four criteria: effectiveness,\nimperceptibility, transferability, and robustness. Our method, Perception-Aware\nChroma-Restrictive Perturbation (PAChroma), generates Uncolorable Examples that\nmeet these four criteria by optimizing imperceptible perturbations with a\nLaplacian filter to preserve perceptual quality, and applying diverse input\ntransformations during optimization to enhance transferability across models\nand robustness against common post-processing (e.g., compression). Experiments\non ImageNet and Danbooru datasets demonstrate that PAChroma effectively\ndegrades colorization quality while maintaining the visual appearance. This\nwork marks the first step toward protecting visual content from illegitimate AI\ncolorization, paving the way for copyright-aware defenses in generative media."}
