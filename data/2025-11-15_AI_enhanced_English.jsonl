To study the effect of model size on accessibility-focused description quality, we evaluate SmolVLM2 variants with 500M and 2.2B parameters across two diverse datasets: AVCaps (outdoor), and Charades (indoor). In this work, we introduce two novel evaluation frameworks specifically designed for BLV accessibility assessment: the Multi-Context BLV Framework evaluating spatial orientation, social interaction, action events, and ambience contexts; and the Navigational Assistance Framework focusing on mobility-critical information. Additionally, we conduct a systematic evaluation of four different prompt design strategies and deploy both models on a smartphone, evaluating FP32 and INT8 precision variants to assess real-world performance constraints on resource-limited mobile devices.", "AI": {"tldr": "SmolVLM2 variants (500M and 2.2B parameters) are evaluated for BLV accessibility, introducing two novel frameworks and assessing prompt strategies and mobile deployment.", "motivation": "High demands of large VLMs hinder practical use for BLV users, necessitating study of model size impact on accessibility-focused descriptions.", "method": "Evaluation of SmolVLM2 variants on AVCaps and Charades datasets, introduction of Multi-Context BLV and Navigational Assistance Frameworks, and testing prompt strategies and mobile deployment (FP32/INT8).", "result": "Performance and constraints of smaller VLMs on mobile devices are assessed, with novel frameworks for BLV accessibility.", "conclusion": "Smaller VLMs can be effective for BLV users, with tailored frameworks and optimizations for mobile deployment."}}

We present the Latent Upscaler Adapter (LUA), a lightweight module that performs super-resolution directly on the generator's latent code before the final VAE decoding step. LUA integrates as a drop-in component, requiring no modifications to the base model or additional diffusion stages, and enables high-resolution synthesis through a single feed-forward pass in latent space. A shared Swin-style backbone with scale-specific pixel-shuffle heads supports 2x and 4x factors and remains compatible with image-space SR baselines, achieving comparable perceptual quality with nearly 3x lower decoding and upscaling time (adding only +0.42 s for 1024 px generation from 512 px, compared to 1.87 s for pixel-space SR using the same SwinIR architecture). Furthermore, LUA shows strong generalization across the latent spaces of different VAEs, making it easy to deploy without retraining from scratch for each new decoder. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LUA closely matches the fidelity of native high-resolution generation while offering a practical and efficient path to scalable, high-fidelity image synthesis in modern diffusion pipelines.", "AI": {"tldr": "LUA, a latent upscaler adapter, enables efficient high-resolution image synthesis in diffusion models by performing super-resolution in latent space, reducing latency and artifacts.", "motivation": "Diffusion models face challenges in scaling beyond training resolutions due to slow high-resolution sampling and artifacts introduced by post-hoc image super-resolution.", "method": "LUA is a lightweight module that performs super-resolution directly on the generator's latent code before the final VAE decoding step, using a shared Swin-style backbone with scale-specific pixel-shuffle heads.", "result": "LUA achieves comparable perceptual quality to pixel-space super-resolution with nearly 3x lower decoding and upscaling time, adding only +0.42 s for 1024 px generation from 512 px.", "conclusion": "LUA provides a practical and efficient solution for high-resolution image synthesis in diffusion models, closely matching native high-resolution generation fidelity while significantly reducing latency and computational costs."}}

In pursuit of minimal modeling, DA3 yields two key insights: a single plain transformer (e.g., vanilla DINO encoder) is sufficient as a backbone without architectural specialization, and a singular depth-ray prediction target obviates the need for complex multi-task learning. Through our teacher-student training paradigm, the model achieves a level of detail and generalization on par with Depth Anything 2 (DA2). We establish a new visual geometry benchmark covering camera pose estimation, any-view geometry and visual rendering. On this benchmark, DA3 sets a new state-of-the-art across all tasks, surpassing prior SOTA VGGT by an average of 44.3% in camera pose accuracy and 25.1% in geometric accuracy.

In the multiple-choice setting - a dominant format for multimodal reasoning benchmarks - the paradigm faces a significant yet often overlooked obstacle: unfaithful trajectories that guess the correct option after a faulty chain of thought receive the same reward as genuine reasoning, which is a flaw that cannot be ignored. We propose Self-Consistency Sampling (SCS) to correct this issue. For each question, SCS (i) introduces small visual perturbations and (ii) performs repeated truncation and resampling of an initial trajectory; agreement among the resulting trajectories yields a differentiable consistency score that down-weights unreliable traces during policy updates. Based on Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, plugging SCS into RLOO, GRPO, and REINFORCE++ series improves accuracy by up to 7.7 percentage points on six multimodal benchmarks with negligible extra computation. SCS also yields notable gains on both Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct and InternVL3-8B, offering a simple, general remedy for outcome-reward RL in MLLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "SCS addresses unfaithful trajectories in outcome-reward RL for MLLMs by using visual perturbations and resampling to generate a consistency score, improving accuracy by up to 7.7 points on benchmarks.", "motivation": "The motivation stems from the flaw in outcome-reward RL where unfaithful trajectories (guessing correctly after faulty reasoning) receive the same reward as genuine reasoning, which undermines the learning process.", "method": "The proposed method, Self-Consistency Sampling (SCS), involves introducing small visual perturbations and performing repeated truncation and resampling of an initial trajectory.
